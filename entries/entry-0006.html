      <p>Today was one of those kind of days.. really busy, menial tasks filling spaces, scrambling to get things done before a big trip..  When I drove into lawn bowling, the front end of the truck was shaking, so after lawn bowling (great fun game with Steve, Peggy and Tim) I drove back to the tire place and explained the issue.</p>
      <p>Turns out, one wheel was put back on the truck without the front weights for balance, and the other front tire was out of round..  So they balance the right front and had to replace the left front.  (These are almost new Michelins.). They didnâ€™t have the tire in stock so they had to order it in.  Meaning back home, then back to the store when it came in the afternoon.. and another 40 minutes waiting to get in.  But, all good and drove home and got a quick nap.</p>
      <p>These are the type days that can stack up and while you are busy, you also feel the routine.  The very kind of day I am trying to recognize moments and be there for.  Easier in retrospect, hard to do in the moment.</p>
